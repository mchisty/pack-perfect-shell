# Pack Perfect Privacy Policy

Last updated: Today

This app is a native wrapper around our web experience. We designed it with privacy-first principles:

- No data collection
- No analytics
- No tracking
- No advertising
- No third‑party SDKs transmitting personal data

What we access
- Network access to load the Pack Perfect website content
- Minimal device capabilities required by the OS WebView (e.g., basic storage for caching)

What we do NOT access
- We do not access contacts, camera, microphone, photos, precise location, Bluetooth, or other sensitive device data.

Data storage
- Any data created by your use of the app remains on your device or within your Pack Perfect account (if you sign in on the website). We do not collect, store, or share personal data from the native app shell.

Children’s privacy
- The app does not target children and does not collect personal information from anyone.

- If you have questions, contact: support@packperfect.app
